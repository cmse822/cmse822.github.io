# Pre-class Assignment 5, due 9/24

## Questions

1. Define _bisection width_.
2. Define the _diameter_ of a network.
3. Do a little internet searching and determine what type of network MSU's HPCC utilizes.

## What to turn-in

Commit your answers to the questions, as a plain text, markdown document, or pdf to your assignment repo _before the start of class_.
