# Pre-class Assignment 16

## Video lectures 

For a good introduction to general GPU architecture, what [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeL50ai5P3k&list=PLcbxjEfgjpO9OeDu--H9_XqyxPj3MkjdN&index=22). Then, watch the two short intro videos on CUDA found [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/how-to-cuda-c-cpp).

## Reading

Read Sections 1 and 2 of the [CUDA C++ Programming Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html)

## Questions

1. List the CUDA _thread_ hierarchy from smallest to largest.
2. List the CUDA _memory_ hierarchy from smallest to largest.

<!-- Then, depending on your language of choice, read the following:

### C/C++
