# Team Rules Contract Form

## Purpose

To establish team norms in order to promote more constructive and productive teamwork.

## Directions

For project teams to work effectively, all team members must clearly understand their responsibilities to one another. These ground rules describe the general responsibilities of every member to the team. Your team can adopt additional ground rules if you believe they are needed. Your signature on this contract form signifies your commitment to adhere to these rules and expectations.

## Team name:

### Team Rules

- Come to team meetings on time.
- Come to class and team meetings with assignments and other necessary preparations
correctly and thoughtfully completed.
- Additional ground rules (add as many as you like; attach an additional sheet if necessary):

### Conflict Resolution

If a member of the team repeatedly fails to meet these rules, other members of the team are expected to take the following actions.

If not resolved, what will the team do? How? When? Who will communicate dissatisfaction to the offending member?

-  
-   
-  

If the matter is still not resolved, the team will meet with the instructor.
If the steps above have been completed without resolving the problem, any team member
may quit the team. Alternatively, if all other team members are in agreement, the offending
team member may be fired from the team. In either case, the removed individual is required to complete the remaining group activities and assignments individually.

The instructor reserves the right to make final decisions to resolve difficulties that arise within a team. Before this becomes necessary, the team is urged to find a fair and equitable solution.
