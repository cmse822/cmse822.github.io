# Syllabus

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION/SUBJECT TO CHANGE**

## Fall 2020, Michigan State University

### Prof. Sean Couch

This graduate-level course covers the practical and theoretical aspects of parallel and high-performance computing in science and engineering.

### Course Goals

At the conclusion of this course, you should be able to

- Benchmark and profile the performance of serial and parallel applications
- Develop and optimize applications using:
  - shared-memory threading parallelism
  - distributed-memory message passing
  - hybrid parallelism 
  - and GPU hardware
- Make effective use of high-performance parallel computing architectures

### Class meetings and office hours

This is a "hybrid" course, meaning mostly online interaction. In-person interaction amongst small groups with appropriate social distancing will occur on an as-needed basis.
The class meets virtually Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10:20 am to 11:40 am Eastern via Zoom, at [this link](). The passcode for the Zoom will be sent to you via email. Class meetings are meant to be highly interactive and you are expected to attend if possible.
Zoom sessions will also be recorded and made available for review.

### Communication and Slack

The primary means of communication for this course will be [Slack](http://slack.com).
There is a workspace specifically for this course at [cmse-822.slack.com](http://cmse-822.slack.com).
You may use your `@msu.edu` email address to join this Slack workspace.
Please join this Slack workspace and participate in discussions.
Discussion of course subject material is encouraged.
You may also send direct messages via Slack to the instructors or any other member of the workspace.
For group work, there will be dedicated channels for each group.

### Text book and references

The two primary textbooks for this course are [High Performance Scientific Computing](https://bitbucket.org/VictorEijkhout/hpc-book-and-course) and [Parallel Programming in Science and Engineering](https://bitbucket.org/VictorEijkhout/parallel-computing-book/src), both by Victor Eijkhout.
Both of these texts are open-source and freely-available from the author.
Supplementary reading and reference material is available on the course webpage under [Resources](resources.md).

### Use of HPCC

Many of the course assignments will utilize the MSU campus High Performance Computing Center (HPCC). All students must obtain an account on the HPCC. The best way to get an HPCC is through your research mentors. If this is not feasible, talk to the course instructor.

### Assignments

The coursework consists of a combination of pre-class assignments and in-class homework. The pre-class assignments will serve as the basis for in-class discussion and so it is important that you complete them---you will be evaluated on your in-class participation.

The assignments will often consist of writing and running code. As such, all assignments will be handed out and turned in via Git repositories on the course's [GitHub Classroom](https://github.com/cmse822f18). The Git history of your assignments should demonstrate the originality of your work.
You will also be graded on the _quality_ of your code.
Please read and refer to the course [coding standards](coding.md) for clear guidelines on writing readable, maintainable code.

No rule of scholarly activity is more important than giving proper credit to the contributions of others. Although you are free to consult with classmates while working on assignments, you must explicitly acknowledge them by name and indicate their contributions in the final write-up.

Many of the assignments will require writing code and routines that may be easily found in publicly-available numerical libraries.
Unless explicitly stated, you should assume that all code required in the assignments must be original.
I.e., do not simply use off-the-shelf code.
The point of the assignments is to give _you_ practice in writing scientific software.

### In-class work, attendance, and extra credit

Class periods will frequently be used for formal discussion of the course material and for in-class homeworks. It is, therefore, very important that you show up, if you can. If you are unable to participate in virtual class meetings, they will be recorded for you to review later. There will often be in-class quizzes to check your understanding of the assigned material. These quizzes will count for extra credit toward your final grade. In order to receive the full amount of extra credit, you will only need to respond correctly to 80% of the questions. There will be no make-up extra credit of any kind.

### Project

In the latter part of the course, you will complete a [longer project](projects.md) in which you will develop and test a highly-parallel code.
You will choose a project from the list that will be available on the course [projects page](projects.md).
At the culmination of the project, you will prepare a recorded talk about your work.
You will also write, in a professional style, detailed code documentation describing your work.
Your project will be peer-reviewed by your classmates.

### Final exam

The final will be an in-class written exam covering the entire range of topics discussed in the course. The final is scheduled for Thursday, December 13, 10 am to 12 pm, in 1230 EGR.

### CMSE Subject Exam in Parallel Computing

This course is one of the subject exam courses for the PhD in CMSE.
For those of you requiring it, your subject exam score will be your final course grade.

### Grading policy

The weights for the course grade are as follows.

Category                                 | %
---------------------------------------- | ---
Pre-class assignments                    | 20%
In-class assignments                     | 40%
In-class quizzes (extra credit)          | (+5%)
Project (code, talk, and docs)           | 40%

The final course grade will be assigned based on the following scale.

Grade        | Overall %
------------ | ----------
4.0          | >=90
3.5          | >=83
3.0          | >=76
2.5          | >=68
2.0          | >=62
1.5          | >=55
1.0          | >=45

Your final grade will be no lower than that indicated on the above scale, though it _may_ be higher, depending on overall class performance.

### Outline of topics

The _tentative_ course schedule is available [here](schedule.md). Updates and details will also be made on that page and communicated via the course Slack channel.

### Spartan Code of Honor Academic Pledge

As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do.

In particular, plagiarism of any kind will result in the complete loss of credit for the assignment, including on the final project, and an associated report to the dean of your college. If you are not completely clear on what constitutes plagiarism, consult the [materials provided by the Graduate School](https://grad.msu.edu/plagiarism).
