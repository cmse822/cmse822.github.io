# Syllabus

## Fall 2018, Michigan State University

### Prof. Sean Couch

This is graduate-level course covers the practical and theoretical aspects of parallel and high-performance computing in science and engineering.

### Course Goals

At the conclusion of this course, you should be able to

- Benchmark and profile the performance of serial and parallel applications
- Develop and optimize applications using shared-memory threading parallelism
- Develop and optimize applications using distributed-memory message passing
- Develop and optimize hybrid parallelism applications
- Use high-performance parallel computing architectures

### Instructor information

Asst. Prof. Sean M. Couch  
Office: 1508G Engineering Building and 3250 Biomedical and Physical Sciences  
Phone: (517) 884-5035  
[couch@pa.msu.edu](mailto:couch@pa.msu.edu)  
[www.pa.msu.edu/~couch](http://www.pa.msu.edu/~couch)  

### Class meetings and office hours

The class meets Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10:20 am to 11:40 am in 1230 Engineering Building. Class meetings are highly interactive and you are expected to bring a laptop to each meeting. Office hours are from 9 am to 10 am on Tuesdays and Thursdays in 1508G Engineering Building.

### Communication and Slack

Primary form of communication will be Slack.
Discussion of course subject material is encouraged. There is a [Slack team](http://cmse822.slack.com) setup for the class for this very purpose. Please join this Slack team and participate in discussions. No rule of scholarly activity is more important than giving proper credit to the contributions of others. Although you are free to consult with classmates while working on assignments, you must explicitly acknowledge them by name and indicate their contributions in the final write-up.

### Text book and references

Primary text is...
Supplementary reading and reference material will be available on the course webpage under [Resources](resources.md).

### Use of HPCC

Many of the course assignments will utilize the MSU campus High Performance Computing Center (HPCC). At some point during the semester there will be an in-class tutorial on using the HPCC. All students must obtain an account on the HPCC. The best way to get an HPCC is through your research mentors. If this is not feasible, talk to the course instructor.

### Assignments

The coursework consists of a combination of reading assignments and problem sets. We will discuss the problems in class, so come ready to present your solutions to the class---you will be evaluated on your in-class participation. Because we discuss the problems in class, it is important to have your assignment done on time.

The homework will often consist of writing and running code. As such, all assignments will be handed out and turned in via git repositories on the course's [GitHub Classroom](site.github.repo). The git history of your assignments should demonstrate the originality of your work.

### Project

In the latter part of the course, you will complete a longer project in which you will develop and test a highly-parallel code using an algorithm of your choice. You will decide on a topic in consultation with the instructor. You will be required to submit a two-page (including references) project proposal arguing the case for your project topic and citing relevant references. Finally, you will write, in a professional style, a report on your work. Project reports will be due following the final class meeting by 5 pm. Project reports will be "peer-reviewed." You will be expected to review up to three of your classmates reports, following a detailed rubric that will be made available on the course website.

### Final exam

The final will be an in-class written exam covering the entire range of topics discussed in the course. The final is scheduled for Friday, December 16, 7:45 am to 9:45 am, in 222 Erickson.

### Grading policy

The weights for the course grade are as follows.

Category                                 | %
---------------------------------------- | ---
Homework (problems, reading assignments) | 40%
In-class participation                   | 10%
Project (incl. proposal and report)      | 30%
Final                                    | 20%

For the reading problem sets, the grading will be on a three-point scale: -, âœ”, +, meaning, respectively, "needs improvement", "satisfactory", and "outstanding." For the longer homework problem sets I will grade the write-up in detail and assign a numerical grade.

### Outline of topics

We will follow the attached _tentative_ outline. Updates and details are available on the online [schedule](schedule.md).

- Modern processor architecture as it pertains to code performance
- Performance benchmarking and modeling of serial code
- Serial and parallel data access
